# Calendify
A simple python script for syncing schedules from different services to a Google Calendar.

## Features
- Smart sync; only syncing the events that have been updated since the last run.
- Multiple calendars; syncing multiple calendars at once, and specifying unique names and configurations for each one.
- Easy sharing; automatically share the google calendar with specific people, or create a shareable link.

## Supported services
- TimeEdit
    - Supports multiple languages
- Skola24
    - Automatically maps colors (approximately, since Google Calendar only supports 10 different colors)

More are to come! Please feel free to create an issue or a pull request if there is a specific host (or target) service you would like me to add.

## Why?
I personally use Google Calendar, but my university uses TimeEdit to provide schedules. So I wrote this simple script to transform one into the other.
